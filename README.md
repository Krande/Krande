## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a structural engineer and open source developer based in Oslo, Norway.

My open source development focuses mainly on improving my structural engineering workflow and sharing my findings with the open source community.

I am the main developer of [ada-py](https://github.com/Krande/adapy) and [paradoc](https://github.com/Krande/paradoc) and I am also a contributor of [IfcOpenShell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell) and various other related CAD/FEM projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on porting Code Aster to MSVC and distribute it as a conda-forge package (see https://gitlab.com/krande/src).
  (This will to let those of us forced to use Windows in our day-jobs enjoy the wonderful code aster Finite Element solver directly from inside our python environment)

If you find anything I've made useful, it is possible to buy me a coffee at my [sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/Krande) as a token of appreciation :)
